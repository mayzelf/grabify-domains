## Introduction

Grabify is a service used to create trackable links that can log IP addresses and other information about the visitors. While this can be used for legitimate purposes, it is often exploited for malicious intent. This repository aims to maintain a comprehensive list of Grabify domains to help users block these domains and protect their privacy.

2. **Import the List:**
   - Import the `grabify_domains.txt` file into your firewall, ad blocker, or any other tool you use to manage blacklists.
